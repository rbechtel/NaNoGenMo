; Start Lisp (I'm using LispWorks).

; Move to the directory where you've got the stuff.

(load "load-nngm.lisp")
(load "extra-stories.lisp") ; because this is last minute

; to generate a chapter out of stories.lisp, e.g., Chapter 1

(spin-episode *story1* nil t t)

; to generate a chapter out of extra-stories.lisp, e.g., Chapter 10

(spin-episode *story10* nil t)
